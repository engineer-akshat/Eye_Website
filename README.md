# Eye Disease Identification Website

## Project Description
This project involves the creation of an innovative web-based platform for detecting eye diseases using deep learning technologies. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the website can analyze retinal images and accurately identify various eye conditions, achieving a classification accuracy of 93%. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, enabling early diagnosis and intervention in ocular healthcare.

The project aims to democratize eye care by providing a scalable, efficient, and accurate diagnostic tool that can be used by healthcare professionals and individuals alike.

## Features
### Deep Learning Integration:
- Utilizes CNNs for accurate detection of eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and macular degeneration.
- Achieves a high classification accuracy of 93%.

### User-Friendly Interface:
- Simple and intuitive web interface for uploading retinal images.
- Provides quick diagnostic results.

### Educational Resources:
- Offers information on eye diseases, symptoms, preventive measures, and the importance of regular check-ups.

### Scalability:
- Designed to accommodate future enhancements and advanced diagnostic capabilities.

### Collaborative Potential:
- Facilitates partnerships with healthcare institutions and organizations for broader impact.

## Objectives
- **Accurate Diagnosis:** Develop a robust system capable of identifying various eye diseases with high precision.
- **Accessibility:** Create a platform that is easy to use for individuals from diverse backgrounds.
- **Early Intervention:** Enable timely medical intervention to prevent disease progression.
- **Education & Awareness:** Provide resources to educate users about ocular health.
- **Scalability:** Ensure the platform can grow to include more advanced features and reach a wider audience.

## System Architecture
The system consists of the following components:

### Data Collection:
- Retinal images sourced from open databases such as Kaggle's "Eye Diseases Classification" and "Ocular Disease Recognition."

### Preprocessing:
- Images are normalized and preprocessed to ensure uniformity.

### Model Development:
- CNN architectures like EfficientNetB3 are used for training the model on labeled datasets.

### Web Platform:
- A user-friendly interface allows users to upload images and view diagnostic results.

### Evaluation:
- The model is rigorously tested to ensure reliability and robustness.
